# Overview

**Felipex** is an ecommerce inspired by the Zara website in which you can register or log in to search and buy clothes according to your tastes.

This website was a great challenge for me, since all the design was done in CSS without using any framework. I was able to achieve the design that I wanted and also make the website completely responsive. Also, I built the functionality of the shopping cart completely in JavaScript, which is different to anything that we have seen on the course.

# Distinctiveness and Complexity

According to the specification, my project must adhere to the following guidelines:

> A project that appears to be an e-commerce site is strongly suspected to be indistinct from Project 2, and your README.md file should be very clear as to why itâ€™s not. Failing that, it should not be submitted; it will be rejected.

My project is different from Commerce for two reasons:

1. The home page has a dynamic menu, built using JavaScript. When we click on one of the three images (children, woman and man) it will display the product categories depending on which image has been clicked.

2. I built shopping cart functionality using JavaScript and LocalStorage, which was a big challenge for me:

- When the user clicks on "Add to basket" the product will be saved in the LocalStorage. In LocalStorage, we store an array containing objects of each product added to the cart with all of the relevant product information.

- The user is able to add items to basket dynamically using JavaScript. On the shopping cart page, there are buttons to increase and decrease the units of the same product. The visibility of these buttons is according to the availability of the product (saved in LocalStorage).

- On the shopping cart page, the user is able to delete a product from their basket which deletes the product from the LocalStorage array. The array is rearranged completely in order to not leave an empty space in the array. This was a very complex part of the build.

# Routes

### Login `/login`

This page contains the login section on the left-hand side which has validation in case the user tries to enter invalid data.

### Register `/register`

This page contains the form with the necessary data so that the user can create their own account to make purchases on the website.

### Logout `/logout`

This function closes the session of the user who is logged in.

### Index `/`

This page contains three clickable images (children, woman and man). If you click on an image you will get to see the menu and the categories of what you just clicked (children, woman or man).

### Products `/products/gender/category`

This page will have all the products registered according to the genre and the category selected in the menu. For each product, we display the image of the product, the name and the price.

If a user clicks on a product, they will see a larger view of the details of the product itself.

### Product `/product/product*id`

This page is divided into two very important parts:

1. Product details: product name, description, price and "Add to Basket" button:

   - Clicking on the "Add to Basket" button for the first time will activate the "Process to order" button.

2. Other products: Randomly shows two other products. Each product displays an image, the price and "Add to Basket" button:

   - Clicking on the "Add to Basket" button for the first time will change button color for reference that has been added.

### Cart `/cart`

This page only contains the nav bar and a div in the HTML. All the rest of the page is created in JavaScript i.e. the title, the number of items added to the cart, the images of the products, the names, the prices, the total value to pay of the products in cart, the button to make the purchase, etc.

### Order Details `/orderDetails`

This page contains the invoice of the purchase made by the user.

### Admin Section `/adminSection`

This page is only visible to admin users and contains a form that can add a new product into the store.

### Search `/search`

Here the user will be able to search a product by name.

### User Menu `/user/menu`

This page contains the user menu where you will have three links:

- Personal info
- Invoice
- Logout

### User Personal Info `/user/personal-info`

This page contains all the information of the user which was entered at the time of registration. On this page, you can update the information.

### User Invoice `/user/invoice`

This page contains all the purchases made by the user in the past.
